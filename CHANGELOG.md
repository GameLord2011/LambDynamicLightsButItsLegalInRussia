- Added a keybind to toggle ON/OFF first-person dynamic lighting.
  - This may be useful to users who use shaders with first-person dynamic lighting included.
    With the addition of an additional mod, or Vanilla in 1.21.9,

- Updated [Yumi Minecraft Libraries: Foundation].

## 4.6.0

- API changes:
  - Deprecated for removal `ItemLightSourceManager.RegisterContext::registryAccess`
    and `EntityLightSourceManager.RegisterContext::registryAccess`
    in favor of `ItemLightSourceManager.RegisterContext::registryLookup`
    and `EntityLightSourceManager.RegisterContext::registryLookup` respectively.
- Updated [Yumi Minecraft Libraries: Foundation].
  - This may fix some synchronization issues on Fabric.

  - The Light block item now lights up with the correct luminance level with dynamic lighting.
- Fixed "Glowing Effect" option not being saved ([#316](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/issues/316)).

## 4.8.1

- Added dynamic light sources culling ([#318](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/issues/318)).
  - This should significantly reduce the amount of chunk section rebuilds processed, which has been one of the notorious sources of lag of this mod.
  - You can disable culling in the Performance tab of the mod in case there's glitches.
- Added adaptive ticking ([#319](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/issues/319)).
  - Light sources far away will tick a bit slower, slowing more the further away they are.
  - The distances (in chunks) for which light sources will begin to slow down is configurable in the new Performance tab of the mod.
  - Light sources behind the camera will tick a lot slower.
- Cleaned up a bit the settings screen and added explanations to the entities dynamic light sources tab.

- Updated [Yumi Minecraft Libraries: Foundation].
  - Fixed crashes with the latest versions of NeoForge.

### 4.8.2

- Updated Turkish translations ([#326](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/pull/326)).

### 4.8.4

- Fixed bad API identifier in NeoForge JarJar metadata.
  - This fixes some issues loading newer versions of LambDynamicLights with mods that include its API JAR on NeoForge.
- Updated Vietnamese translations ([#330](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/pull/330)).

### 4.8.5

- Fixed bad Maven metadata which prevented auto-import of some libraries needed by LambDynamicLights.
  - This update is only technical, as such this update only affects the publishing of the mod for other modders to use.

### 4.8.6

- Improved dynamic lighting crash report data to be less confusing.
- Fixed an obscure conflict with mods bundling a modified and older implementation of LambDynamicLights.
  - *Developer's Note: this issue is specifically caused by Mixin loosing track of who is the owner of a `@Unique` field across inheritance.
    The fix is to only rely on the interface methods that should be unique enough to prevent future issues.
    This also means this is an issue which is load-order dependent.*

### 4.8.7

- Fixed Warden Sonic Boom dynamic light toggle not working ([#341](https://github.com/LambdAurora/LambDynamicLights/issues/341)).
