# LambDynamicLights, but without the pride flags

This is the same as the og mod, just without the pride flags in the config menu or the devbuild switch because I don't want to publish this mod. I'M NOT HOMOPHOBIC, I JUST DON'T AGREE WITH THAT STUFF BECAUSE I'M A CHRISTIAN.

This is mainly a personal project, but I'm open-sourcing it so that you can use it if you want to.
